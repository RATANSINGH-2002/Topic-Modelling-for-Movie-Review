# Topic Modelling for Movie Review

## Overview

This project provides a detailed analysis of movie reviews using topic modeling techniques. The goal is to extract and visualize hidden topics in a large collection of movie reviews, helping to understand the main themes and sentiments expressed by viewers.

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook (`Topic Modeling Movie review.ipynb`) and uses LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) as the primary topic modeling algorithm.

## Features

- Preprocessing of raw movie review text data
- Tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal
- Topic modeling using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
- Interactive visualization of topics with pyLDAvis
- Analysis and interpretation of extracted topics

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
- gensim
- pyLDAvis
- matplotlib

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk gensim pyLDAvis matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RATANSINGH-2002/Topic-Modelling-for-Movie-Review.git
   cd Topic-Modelling-for-Movie-Review
   ```

2. **Install the requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Or install libraries individually, as listed above.)*

3. **Open the notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Topic Modeling Movie review.ipynb"
   ```

4. **Run the cells step-by-step:**  
   Follow the notebook instructions to preprocess the data, train the LDA model, and visualize the results.

## Dataset

- The notebook expects a dataset of movie reviews. Please make sure your data is in the appropriate format (CSV, text, etc.).  
- If a sample dataset is not provided in the repo, you can use publicly available datasets such as [IMDb Movie Reviews](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

## Main Steps in the Notebook

1. **Data Loading:**  
   Load the movie reviews into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Text Preprocessing:**  
   - Tokenization
   - Lemmatization
   - Stopword removal

3. **Building the Dictionary and Corpus:**  
   Prepare the data for topic modeling with Gensim.

4. **LDA Topic Modeling:**  
   Train an LDA model to extract topics from the movie reviews.

5. **Visualization:**  
   Use pyLDAvis to interactively explore the topics.

6. **Analysis:**  
   Interpret and analyze the top topics and their keywords.

## Example Output

- A list of discovered topics, each represented by keywords
- Interactive visualization (pyLDAvis) to explore topic relevance and term distribution

## Results

- Summarize the major topics found in the movie reviews.
- Discuss any interesting insights (e.g., common themes, sentiment trends).
